# Comprehensive Testing Project Plan for Published Functionality

## Risk-Based Testing Matrix

### Priority Levels
- **P0 - Critical Path**: Payment processing, authentication, data persistence, security features
  - *Required Tests*: ALL test types
- **P1 - Standard Features**: Core business logic, user workflows, API endpoints
  - *Required Tests*: ALL test types (was: Integration, Boundary, Regression, Performance, Security)
- **P2 - Low-Risk Features**: UI elements, informational pages, logging
  - *Required Tests*: Integration, Regression, Accessibility

## Checkpoint Protocol (Every ~10% of Resources)

To prevent losing huge swaths of implemented tests when the AI conversation is suddenly cut-off.

## Emergency Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback Triggers
1. Data corruption or loss
2. Security breach detection
3. >50% performance degradation
4. Critical feature failure in production

### Rollback Process
```bash
1. Trigger emergency notification
2. Switch traffic to previous version
3. Preserve current state for debugging
4. Validate rollback success
5. Incident report within 2 hours
```

## Continuous Handoff Protocol

### Session Transition Package
- Current phase & checkpoint
- Test execution status
- Critical issues list
- Environmental dependencies
- Next session priorities
- Access credentials & tokens
- Contact points for blockers

### Recovery Instructions
If session terminates unexpectedly:
1. Load last checkpoint state
2. Verify environment stability
3. Resume from last completed test
4. Update checkpoint with gap analysis

This plan ensures comprehensive testing coverage while maintaining efficient resource utilization and enabling seamless handoffs between sessions.
