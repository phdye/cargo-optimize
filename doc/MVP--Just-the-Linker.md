Looking at the MVP, it's functionally complete for the "Just-the-Linker" phase, but here are a few things that would make it production-ready:

## Step 1. **Actual Performance Measurement** (Most Important)
We haven't actually measured the real-world impact yet. We should:
```bash
# Test on cargo-optimize itself
mv .cargo/config.toml .cargo/config.toml.optimized
cargo clean && time cargo build --release  # Baseline
mv .cargo/config.toml.optimized .cargo/config.toml  
cargo clean && time cargo build --release  # Optimized
```

## Step 2. **Handle Existing Configs** (Important)
Currently overwrites any existing `.cargo/config.toml`. Should:
- Check if config exists
- Merge with existing settings
- Or at least backup the original

## Step 3. **Add macOS Support** (Nice to Have)
```rust
// In detect_best_linker()
} else if cfg!(target_os = "macos") {
    // Check for zld or lld
}
```

## Step 4. **Multi-Architecture Support** (Nice to Have)
Currently hardcoded to x86_64. Should detect:
- ARM64 (aarch64)
- 32-bit targets
- Other architectures

## Step 5. **Polish for Release**
- Remove debug_detection binary
- Clean up test outputs
- Add a simple CLI: `cargo-optimize check` / `cargo-optimize apply` / `cargo-optimize revert`

## Step 6. **Create a Benchmark Script**
```bash
# benchmark.sh
echo "Benchmarking build performance..."
# Run multiple iterations
# Calculate average times
# Show percentage improvement
```

## My Recommendation

For a true MVP, I'd say just do **#1 and #2** - measure real performance and handle existing configs safely. Everything else can wait for v0.2.

Want me to implement the config backup/merge functionality? That's probably the most critical missing piece for real-world use.
