You're absolutely right! I apologize for the confusion. Looking at your actual file listing, **ALL files have execute permissions** (`rwxrwxr-x`), which is incorrect. The `.md` files, `.toml` files, `.rs` source files, and other plain text files should definitely NOT have execute permissions.

This is a common issue when files are created on Windows and viewed in Cygwin/Unix environment. Let me create a proper script to fix these permissions:## You're Absolutely Right! 

Those files **should NOT have execute permissions**. This is a common issue when files are created on Windows and accessed through Cygwin. Here's how to fix it immediately:

### üö® **Immediate Fix - Run This Now:**

```bash
# Remove execute permissions from ALL files first
find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;

# Then add execute ONLY to shell scripts
chmod 755 setup.sh fix-permissions.sh

# Verify the fix
ls -l
```

### üìä **What Should Have Execute Permissions:**

| File | Should Have Execute? | Current | Correct |
|------|---------------------|---------|---------|
| `*.md` files | ‚ùå NO | `rwxrwxr-x` | `rw-r--r--` (644) |
| `*.toml` files | ‚ùå NO | `rwxrwxr-x` | `rw-r--r--` (644) |
| `*.rs` files | ‚ùå NO | `rwxrwxr-x` | `rw-r--r--` (644) |
| `build.rs` | ‚ùå NO | `rwxrwxr-x` | `rw-r--r--` (644) |
| `LICENSE*` files | ‚ùå NO | `rwxrwxr-x` | `rw-r--r--` (644) |
| `*.bat` files | ‚ùå NO | `rwxrwxr-x` | `rw-r--r--` (644) |
| `.gitignore` | ‚ùå NO | `rwxrwxr-x` | `rw-r--r--` (644) |
| `setup.sh` | ‚úÖ YES | `rwxrwxr-x` | `rwxr-xr-x` (755) |
| `fix-permissions.sh` | ‚úÖ YES | (after chmod) | `rwxr-xr-x` (755) |

### üîß **Complete Fix Script:**

I've created `fix-permissions.sh` that will properly fix all permissions. After running the commands above, you can use this script in the future:

```bash
# First, make the fix script executable
chmod 755 fix-permissions.sh

# Then run it to fix all permissions
./fix-permissions.sh
```

### üìù **For Version Control:**

Add this to your git commit to ensure correct permissions are tracked:

```bash
# After fixing permissions, update git's tracking
git update-index --chmod=-x *.md *.toml *.rs *.bat build.rs LICENSE* .gitignore .gitattributes
git update-index --chmod=+x setup.sh fix-permissions.sh

# Commit the permission changes
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: remove execute permissions from non-executable files"
```

You were completely right - documentation files, source code, and configuration files should NEVER have execute permissions! Only actual scripts that need to be executed should have them.
