//! # cargo-optimize
//!
//! Automatically optimize Rust build times with zero configuration.
//!
//! ## Quick Start
//!
//! Add to your `Cargo.toml`:
//! ```toml
//! [build-dependencies]
//! cargo-optimize = "0.1"
//! ```
//!
//! In your `build.rs`:
//! ```no_run
//! cargo_optimize::auto_configure();
//! ```
//!
//! That's it! Your builds will automatically be optimized.
